Q5.Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, also you have to show in what scenario --force-with-lease is used?
 
When there is a git push you want to perform and the remote repo rejects it, there is a dangerous way to make it work:
git push --force.

This dangerous method is so popular most IDEs have a special checkbox for it. But force has a sibling which is not getting enough attention:
git push --force-with-lease.
