Question 5

Difference between --force push and --force-with-lease, You have to show the use of both, also you have to show in what scenario 
--force-with-lease is used?

--force is a destructive and it overwrites the remote repository by deleting the changes in it.
--force-with-lease checks for any changes made in the remote repository that are not updated locally. If the code is unable to push, then
   we'll need to update our local repository first and then pushing our work to remote repo.

force-with-lease should be used if we need to push the changes made in local repo without damaging the entire files.
