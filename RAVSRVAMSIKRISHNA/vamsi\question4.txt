Question 4: How to delete one commit or multiple commits permanently Write command for it.

There are 2 cases here 
1. Deleting recent commits 
2. Delete something which is in the middle of the tree.

Case-1: 
 git reset --hard HEAD~num(where nu is the number of commits this commit is far) and finally push it into the repository

Case-2: 
 git rebase -i HEAD~num
 Change to drop.
