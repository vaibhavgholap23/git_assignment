Cherry Pick is used to bring the commits from branches to current working HEAD. There are other commands like rebase or merge but they 
merge the entire branch. Cherry pick brings only the selected commit

steps to use 
a. Get the commit ID using git log 
b. Come to main branch and type the command "git cherry-pick commit_id"

if we want to add this to staging area instead of commiting use the command git cherry-pick -h
